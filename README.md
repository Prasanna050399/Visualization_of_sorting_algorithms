# Visualization_of_sorting_algorithms
visualising sorting algorithms.
In the current stage only normal sorting algorithms are visualized. 

This repository contains two program files:

1. proj_try1.py:
  The program when executed asks for a choice of sorting algorithm.
  As of now the script only contains three sorting algorithms, these algorithms are as follows:

A. Selection Sort:
  When we enter 1 for selection sort, the program creates an array of integers. The values in the array are totally random, however with some extra code, the elements are not repeated.
  The following images shows how the program looks when selection sort is selected for execution.

  The Final Output is as follows:

B. Insertion Sort:
  This is the second algorithm that we are visualizing. 
  The steps are similar as that of selection sort.

  The final Output is as follows:

C. Bubble Sort:
  This is the last algorithm in the proj_try1.py script.
